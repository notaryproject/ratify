# Validation
Our goal is to automate as much testing as possible with unit and integration tests. For all CLI test scenarios covered today, please see [cli-test.bats](bats/cli-test.bats). For all base ratify tests + notation tests, please see [base-test.bats](bats/base-test.bats). For all external plugin related tests, please see [plugin-test.bats](bats/plugin-test.bats). For all Azure supported test scenarios covered today, please see [azure-test.bats](bats/azure-test.bats).

## Unsupported Tests

While we are working on improving our coverage, here is the list of scenarios that currently require manual validation: 
- Azure Managed Identity Auth Provider
